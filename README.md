# Protein Catalog Website with Shopping Cart and localStorage

In this project, a dedicated website was developed to offer a protein catalog for the gym, with the ability to add products to the shopping cart and store this information using localStorage.

# The key aspects of the project are as follows:

- Protein Catalog: a complete catalog of proteins available for sale is presented, organized in a way that is intuitive and accessible to users. Each product includes details such as name, description, price and purchase options.

- Shopping Cart Functionality: An interactive shopping cart is implemented that allows users to select and add proteins to their cart. Users can view the contents of their cart at any time, add or remove products, and update the quantity of units of each item.

- Data Storage with localStorage: localStorage is used to store users' shopping cart information persistently in the browser. This allows users to return to the page in different sessions and keep the selected products in their cart.

- Friendly User Interface: The website has an attractive and easy-to-use user interface, designed to provide a smooth and pleasant shopping experience for users.

- Security and Privacy: Security measures are implemented to protect user information, such as encryption of sensitive data and protection against known security vulnerabilities.

- Additional Functionality: Additional functionality can be included, such as the option to filter products by type, brand or price, as well as the ability to perform specific searches within the protein catalog.
